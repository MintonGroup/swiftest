	abstract = {The Swifter software package, written by David E. Kaufmann, is a completely redesigned and improved version of the Swift package of Hal Levison and Martin Duncan. Like Swift, Swifter is designed to integrate a set of mutually gravitationally interacting bodies together with a group of massless test particles that feel the gravitational influence of the massive bodies but do not affect each other or the massive bodies. In addition, the SyMBA integrator supports a second class of massive bodies whose masses are less than some user-specified value. These bodies gravitationally interact with the more massive bodies, but do not interact with each other. Seven integration techniques are included in the current beta release of Swifter:},
